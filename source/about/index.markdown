Hi!

I am a 22 years old French Computer Science Student at the [University of Technology of Belfort-Montb√©liard](http://www.utbm.fr/) (France), but I'm currently studying at [St. Olaf College](http://www.stolaf.edu/), MN as an exchange student and French TA.

I have solid programming skills on various languages ranging from low to high level, such as C, C++, Ruby or Java and a good adaptation ability to new languages and concepts. I am currently learning Ruby on Rails and CoffeeScript.

I am interested in Web development (back-end, frameworks, APIs creation), Mobile applications development (Android, iOS) and embedded systems.
